# Standard Steps in Machine Learning Model Development and Workflow vs Pipeline

## 1. Load and Clean the Data
- Load the dataset (CSV, SQL, API, etc.)
- Handle missing values (delete, fill with mean/median/mode)
- Handle outliers (remove, transform, cap)
- Deal with duplicate data
- Convert data types (e.g., categorical variables to numerical)
- Basic data checks (shape, column names, data types)

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Calculate basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, quantiles, etc.)
- Analyze target variable distribution
- Check correlations between features
- Visualize data (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc.)
- Identify patterns and trends in the data
- Understand feature importance and impact

## 3. Data Preparation and Preprocessing
- Feature selection (remove irrelevant or redundant features)
- Feature engineering (create new features, transform existing ones)
- Feature scaling (standardization, normalization)
- Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding, label encoding)
- Handle imbalanced data (oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE)
- Data splitting (training, validation, test sets)

## 4. Model Training
- Choose algorithms suitable for the problem (classification, regression, clustering, etc.)
- Set model parameters
- Train the model on the training set
- Use cross-validation to assess model stability
- Hyperparameter tuning (grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization)
- Model ensembling (voting, stacking, boosting)

## 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate model performance on the test set
- Use appropriate evaluation metrics:
  - Classification: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR
  - Regression: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²
- Analyze confusion matrix (for classification problems)
- Check for overfitting/underfitting
- Compare performance of different models
- Analyze model strengths and weaknesses

## 6. Model Deployment and Monitoring (Advanced Step)
- Model serialization (save the trained model)
- Create API or integrate into applications
- Monitor model performance
- Handle data drift issues
- Retrain the model periodically
- A/B test new models

In our credit card fraud detection project, we indeed follow these standard steps, with each step handled by a dedicated function:

1. **Load and Clean Data** → `load_and_clean_data()`
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** → `perform_eda()`
3. **Data Preparation and Preprocessing** → `prepare_data()` and `handle_imbalanced_data()`
4. **Model Training** → `train_and_evaluate_model()` (training part)
5. **Model Evaluation** → `train_and_evaluate_model()` (evaluation part)

This structured approach makes the machine learning process clearer and more organized, and also helps in understanding the purpose and importance of each step. When developing your own machine learning projects, following these steps will help ensure your model development process is comprehensive and effective.

## Workflow
- **How to achieve our goa**l (could be manually, automatically)
- Higher level of blue print
- A roadmap describing ML steps
### General ML Workflow (Step-by-Step)
1️⃣ **Define the Problem** 
- What are we trying to predict? (e.g., fraud detection, stock price forecasting)
- What data do we have? (structured or unstructured?)
- What is the business impact?

2️⃣ **Data Collection** 
- Gather data from databases, APIs, web scraping, or manual entry.
- Identify missing values, inconsistencies, or bias in data.

3️⃣ **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** 
- Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and fix outliers.
- Normalize, standardize, or encode categorical features.

4️⃣ **Feature Engineering** 
- Select the most relevant features (Feature Selection).
- Transform variables (Scaling, PCA, One-Hot Encoding).

5️⃣ **Model Selection & Training** 
- Choose a suitable ML model (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Neural Networks, etc.).
- Train the model on the dataset and tune hyperparameters.

6️⃣ **Model Evaluation & Validation** 
- Measure accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, etc.
- Use techniques like cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

7️⃣ **Model Deployment** 
- Convert the model into an API, web app, or cloud service.
- Serve predictions in real-time or batch processing.

8️⃣ **Monitoring & Maintenance** 
- Track model drift and retrain when needed.
- Update features or retrain the model periodically

## Pipeline
- **How to achieve out workflow automatically**

### General ML Pipeline (Automated Execution)
**1️⃣ Data Ingestion** 
- Automatically pulls raw data from databases, APIs, or streaming sources.  
**2️⃣ Data Preprocessing** 
- Automatically cleans missing values, normalizes features, and encodes categorical data.  
**3️⃣ Feature Engineering**
- Extracts useful features using automated tools (e.g., PCA, feature selection).  
**4️⃣ Model Training** 
- Trains different models and selects the best one using hyperparameter tuning (e.g., Grid Search, AutoML).  
**5️⃣ Model Evaluation**
- Automatically computes metrics and selects the best model for deployment.  
**6️⃣ Model Deployment**
- Deploys the model as an API or cloud service (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, AWS, GCP).  
**7️⃣ Continuous Monitoring & Retraining** 
- Periodically retrains the model if performance drops.
